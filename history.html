        <h2 style="margin-top:120px;">Summary of My Life</h2>
        <p>I was born in Houston, Texas of 2002 to my mother, Masako. My mother is Japanese and my father, Matthew, is Dutch, Irish, and a mix of other European nationalities, making me half Japanese and half white. Two years later my brothers Akira and Yoshiki who are twins were born. After living in Texas for about 6 years, my family and I moved to California due to my dad's work and ever since I have been living in California. I went to Ortega Elementary, Ingrid B Lacy Middle, and then my local high school, Terra Nova High School. After going through freshman year, and going into a month of sophomore year, I transferred to <a href="http://www.designtechhighschool.org/" target="_blank" style="color:#87cefa;">Design Tech High School</a> after getting my acceptance email. This school has been very good to me so far and I enjoy it here very much.</p>
